    <li><em>The Consultant:</em> "This is just how we work."</li>
    <li><div class="smaller"><em>The Credit Crunch Consultant:</em> "I'll do it your way."</div></li>
    <li><em>The Fait Accompli:</em> "See, it just works" (after two months of covert hackery)</li>
    <li><em>Enlist a Deputy:</em> sell the idea to someone else, then get them to present it. You can wade in and answer the harder questions.</li>
    <li><em>Divide and Conquer:</em> never introduce an idea to many people at once. Spend time with each person, sounding out their concerns, then make sure you have an answer for each concern.</li>
    <li><em>The Alpha Course:</em> Send 'em to a conference or training course.</li>
