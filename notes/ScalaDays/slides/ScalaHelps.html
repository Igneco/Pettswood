<h1>Why is this easier in Scala?</h1>
<em>Terseness.</em> Fixture code is much, much smaller, so it is easier to read and maintain. Pettswood has only 470 lines of production code (and 921 lines of test code).
<ul class="notes">
    <li><em>Built-in XML processing</em>. HTML is just a subset of XML (except for where it is horribly broken, but that is another topic)</li>
    <li><em>First-class functions</em>, such as declaring probe classes in the MultiRow table.</li>
    <li><em>Anonymous inline functions</em>, such as adding Concepts to the DomainBridge in Mixins</li>
    <li><em>Pattern matching</em>, especially when applied to XML parsing</li>
    <li><em>Case classes</em>, for short, simple Probes</li>
    <li><em>Object-oriented</em>, for the bits that aren't sequence transformations</li>
