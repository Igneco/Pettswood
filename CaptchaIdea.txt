Captcha=images with words in them, used to distinguish real people using a website from bots

Idea=get people to click on the part of the image comtaining an object, e.g. "to continue, click on the plane"

Use mechnical turk to find the images. Also use it for phase two: determine/draw the boundaries of the named item within the images

Another idea=offer Captcha as a service

Another idea=search by name for images in google and then just serve those

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA for a good write-up under the heading "Image-recognition CAPTCHAs"
