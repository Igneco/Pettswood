DONE - Allow some sort of shared state to propagate between tests in a single spec. Make this accessible to concepts in some clever way.

Exceptions
 - Hide exception traces, except for important bits
 - Put some nicer hints in to get people started fixing the exceptions
 - Show full stack traces on demand

Index
 - Drop index data (test name, success/failure, etc) into some JSON, ready for retrieval by an Elm app
 - Alternatively, feed output to a standard sbt TestListener, and write something that reads the standard format. Seems a bit dull, though.

Finish the feature to copy css & js from named locations to the target directory. This allows other modules, especially bootstrap, to have their own folders with css/js/font files inside. We should be able to:
 - copy an entire tree, e.g.:
    bootstrap
        |
        |--css
        |--images
        |--js
 - specify more than one tree to copy

Rename javascript folder to js
